Collection Methods:
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.

The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.

The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.
