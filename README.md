Project purpose:
To identify the relationships between Anxiety, depression and insomnia versus certain genres of music.
Questions to answer:
Do any of the given mental health issues have a high relationship between any musical genres?

-   Does the frequency that you listen to a genre correlate a mental health issue?
    - Is this more prevalent among people's favorite genres? 
-   Is there a significant correlation between certain mental health issues and Age?

Target Audience:
- Those afflicted with insomnia, depression and/or insomnia
- People who are curious how music may affect certain mental health conditions

What needs improvement(Wish list):
- Time spent listening to one specific genre per day
- Names of artists most often listened to
- Greater breadth of data ages

To Make Reproducible:
    The data collection for frequency did so with non-numeric phrases, so converting those to a useable numeric metric is important
    Some of the ages were omitted from peoples submission of the form so those rows, when using the ages can't be used.
    Most of the data was well maintained.

Design Choices:
    Histograms were used to show the distribution of data based on responses. The last tab of 3 histograms used different colors 
    to impart visual clarity.
    The scatterplot was used to illustrate the lack of correlation via visual means.
    Correlation matrix was used to give an evaluation of the actual correlation between the genres and the mental health issues for those
    more interested in the details of the data.

Collection Methods:
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.

The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.

The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.
